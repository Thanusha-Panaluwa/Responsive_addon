                    The Nine Arches Bridge (Sinhala: ‡∂Ü‡∂ª‡∑î‡∂ö‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∑î ‡∂±‡∂∏‡∂∫‡∑ö ‡∂¥‡∑è‡∂Ω‡∂∏,) also
                    called the Bridge in the Sky, is a viaduct bridge in Sri
                    Lanka. It is one of the best examples of colonial-era
                    railway construction in the country. It is located in
                    Demodara, between Ella and Demodara railway stations. The
                    surrounding area has seen a steady increase of tourism due
                    to the bridge's architectural ingenuity and the profuse
                    greenery in the nearby hillsides. The construction of the
                    bridge is generally attributed to a local Ceylonese builder,
                    P. K. Appuhami, in consultation with British engineers. The
                    chief designer and project manager of the 'upcountry railway
                    line of Ceylon' project was D. J. Wimalasurendra, a
                    distinguished Ceylonese engineer and inventor.The designer
                    of the viaduct was Harold Cuthbert Marwood of Railway
                    Construction Department of Ceylon Government Railway. The
                    1923 report titled "Construction of a Concrete Railway
                    Viaduct in Ceylon" published by the Engineering Association
                    of Ceylon has details of all the records including the plans
                    and drawings. Popular rumours suggest that when construction
                    work commenced on the bridge, the Great War began between
                    the empires of Europe and the steel assigned for this site
                    was reallocated to Britain's War related projects at the
                    battlefront. As a result, the work came to a standstill,
                    leading the locals to build the bridge with stone bricks and
                    cement, but without steel.
